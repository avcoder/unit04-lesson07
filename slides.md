# Web Security
What's one thing you'd be terrified of if your web app got hacked?

- Definition: When the web server and all of its applications are protected and measures are put in place to protect it from harm
- Online threats are real (see Break slide)
- Users need to be able to trust that websites will keep their information safe (ex: credit card info, personal info, etc.)
- We need to be aware of the risks / pitfalls
- Consequences range from:
  - Loss of control, Loss of access, Identity theft, Data theft, Monetary theft, Spying, Embarassment

# BUT nothing can be 100% secure
M.I. [classic scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifwngc8FHZM)

- new vulnerabilities arise as software changes or don't expect over time
  - software gets upgraded/added
  - configurations get changed
  - data gets updated
- Zero-Day Vulnerability: A software flaw which exposes a vulnerability but does not yet have a fix
- Overall security is only as strong as your weakest link
- Your mission: to raise the weakest points as difficult to exploit as possible, without making it a horrible experience for your users

# Principle of Least Privilege
Control access to systems and resources by granting as little access as possible

- Every program and every user should operate using the least amount of privilege necessary to complete the job
- ex: if user's job is to edit text, then they should not able to browse financial data
- ex: no user should be able to edit their system access privileges
- this applies to:
  - APIs, system resources, database access, software version control, webpages

# Other General Principles

1. Simple is more secure: A house with 1 door vs. ten houses with doors and windows?
   - The larger and more complex the system, the larger attack surface, the harder it is to secure
   - üí° Use clearly named fns and vars, write comments answering 'why', prefer built-in well-tested libraries
2. Never trust users: be paranoid, every user is a potential hacker or victim of [social engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG5vsPJ5Tos)
   - devices/passwords can get stolen, user forgot to logout, disgruntled employee, contractors
   - üí° ability to quickly revoke/quarantine access
3. Expect the unexpected
   - user enters no text, too much text, paste formatted text, emojis, HTML/JS, can db query be modified
   - üí° purify/sanitize inputted text in case users submit accidental/intentional HTML/JS
4. Resilience: identify, respond, recover
   - maintain operational continuity
   - üí° monitoring systems that notify if something go wrong/suspicious, DevOps team or on call staff
5. Security through obscurity: less information given out, the better
   - üí° Hide info in login error messages, server info in response HEADER, web url file extensions
